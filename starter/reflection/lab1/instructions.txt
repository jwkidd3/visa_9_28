Description:
Use BasicDiscoveryExample as your starting point.

Convert BasicDiscoveryExample into a replacement for the
JDK command-line utility javap. javap provides a source-code
like view of a class, showing class structure, fields, and methods.

In your replacement, show the class structure, all public fields,
methods, and constructors. The order of the output should follow:

public class MyClass extends ParentClass {

  public static String staticField;
  public String instanceField;

  public MyClass() {}

  public String getInstanceField() {}

  public static String getStaticField() {}

}

If you want a real challenge, make the output compilable.
