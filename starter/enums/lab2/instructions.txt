Description:
Modify Enum Lab 1. 

Refactor the enumeration implementation, adding a more robust static factory method.
Regardless of the case of the String passed in, if the String matches a Month’s name, the Month should be returned. 

Additionally, associate a season with each enum value and make it accessible through a getSeason method call. 

Modify your application to use the enum modifications.
