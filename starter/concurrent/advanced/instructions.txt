Description:

Create a basic site map creation utility.
The site map creation utility should generate a text file containing all of
the domain-specific URLs found on a given website. Associated with each domain,
should be a indicator denoting whether the URL was accessible.
The site map utility does not need to track images, only <a href> tags.
Use multiple threads to make the utility efficient. There should be one thread that finds <a href>s,
one thread that processes <a href>s. A map could be used to represent the “indexed” site.
A queue could be used as the shared resource representing the unindexed / untested elements of the site.

When all of the <a href>s are processed, the application should generate a text file and then shut-down gracefully.
