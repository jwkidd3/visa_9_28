Description:
Create an application that persists and restores a JavaBean using
the XML mechanism. Use the NameBean as your JavaBean. Store the
persisted NameBean in a file called family.xml. The application should
support a command line argument to specify whether the bean should be
saved or restored.

To make this fun (and see the power of an object graph), have the
application create a family of NameBeans. The family should be
stored in a list. Instead of storing just the single NameBean, store
the entire family.

Once you have written your family to the family.xml file, examine it
with your favorite text editor. Notice the object graph that was created
during the persistence of your family.

For a real challenge, consider writing a PropertyChangeListener
and associating it with the Dad's NameBean's lastName bound property.

After restoring the stored NameBean, trigger an PropertyChangeEvent by
changing the lastName property of Dad. Upon receiving the event, the
event listener should print a message noting that the last name has
changed, and then the event listener should proceed to change all of the
lastNames in the family to match the dads. After the family's last
names have been changed, the application should save the modified
family.
